The content on this site
([source](https://github.com/clojure-doc/clojure-doc.github.io)) is a categorized and
manifold collection of documentation guides for the Clojure programming language and
its ecosystem.

We recognize that different Clojure users have different level of expertise
and separates content into several groups:

 * [Essentials](#essentials)
 * [Language Guides](#language-guides)
 * [Ecosystem & Tools](#the-clojure-ecosystem) (tools, libraries, community, books) guides
 * [Tutorials & Cookbooks](#tutorials-and-cookbooks)


## Essentials

What makes developing in Clojure unique is that we have a focus on
interactive programming: not just the REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) that
Clojure provides but working in an editor that integrates well with the
REPL experience to allow you to evaluate your code, in small pieces,
directly from your editor as you write the code. This provides immediate
feedback as you are exploring your problem space and "growing" your
application.

These first three sections should help you get Clojure and some basic
tooling installed, learn the basics of the language, and get a good
editor setup that allows you to program interactively.
