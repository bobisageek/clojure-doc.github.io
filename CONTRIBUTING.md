**clojure-doc.org** welcomes all sorts of contributions!

See [How to Contribute](https://github.com/clojure-doc/clojure-doc.github.io#how-to-contribute)
in the README file for some guidelines.

The important part is that the source of this site is on the `source`
branch, and the `main` branch is auto-generated from the source using
Cryogen. If you see any problems with the published site and wish to
contribute a Pull Request, you'll need to identify the source file on
the `source` branch and create a branch from that on which to make
your changes, then submit the Pull Request from that against the
`source` branch of this project.
